# 💻 Interview Prep Guide

This repository contains DSA, Low-Level Design (LLD) questions, and everything else I’m using to prepare for my upcoming interviews.

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

The idea is simple, I’m preparing seriously for interviews.
I have around 3 years of experience in software engineering, and now I’m aiming for good companies with better opportunities, pay, and meaningful work.

Honestly, I’m tired of low packages while my friends are landing great roles. I’ve had enough and this time, I’m not stopping until I get my dream job one that offers:

A great work-life balance

A team of genuinely good people

Meaningful and challenging projects

I created this repository to track my progress, revise concepts, and document my journey not just for myself, but also for anyone who’s walking the same path.

## 🧠 My Preparation Plan

I’ve set a 2-month timeline for myself.

Daily:
-Solve at least 2 DSA problems
-Solve 1 LLD problem

Weekends:
Conduct mock interviews with friends
Evaluate based on:

    -Communication

    -Code quality

    -Explanation & clarity

This repo will contain all problems, notes, and progress updates.

## ⚡ Motivation

If you’re someone who keeps saying

“I’ll switch when the time is right,”
“Maybe after I get some more experience,”

Stop waiting, dost. That “right time” never comes.

Just start now your future self will thank you.
Hopefully, you’re reading this after I’ve achieved my goal, and it inspires you to start your own journey too.

## 🚀 Final Note

We’re aiming high and the higher the aim, the tougher the challenge.
Big companies test real, deep software engineering knowledge, and we’ll face that one topic at a time.

Let’s keep going.
No excuses. No turning back.

This journey can change our entire life’s trajectory.

let's goooooo
